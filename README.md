## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mato200/MultiVibeChat.git
cd MultiVibeChat
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install PyQt6 PyQt6-WebEngine
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python MVC2.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **First Launch**: The app will open with all four AI services loaded
2. **Login**: Click "Login Mode: OFF" to enable manual login mode, then sign in to each service. I recommend signing in 1st to google's Ai studio
3. **Send Prompts**: Type your prompt in the text box and press `Ctrl+Enter` or click "Send to All"
4. **Compare Responses**: View responses from all AIs simultaneously

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Enter` - Send prompt to all AIs
- `Ctrl+Scroll` - Zoom in/out in any panel
- `Alt` (hold) - Show URL bars
- `Ctrl+Shift+I` - Open developer tools (right-click)

### Profile Management

**Creating Profiles:**
1. Type a new profile name in the Profile dropdown
2. Click "Switch / Create"
3. A new window will open with the new profile

**Switching Profiles:**
1. Select an existing profile from the dropdown
2. Click "Switch / Create"

Profiles store separate authentication states, cookies, and settings.

### Login Mode

The "Login Mode" toggle allows manual interaction with websites:
- **OFF** (default): Prompts are automatically sent to all AIs
- **ON**: Disables automatic prompt injection, allowing you to manually interact with login pages
- idk if this is actually true lol, AI made a summary

Use Login Mode when:
- Signing in for the first time
- Handling two-factor authentication
- Dealing with OAuth flows

### Pop-up Authentication

When services use OAuth pop-up windows (like Grok's Google sign-in):
1. Click the sign-in button on the service
2. A pop-up window will appear
3. Complete the authentication (It asked me for 2FA confirm on my phone)
4. The pop-up will auto-close when done

Alternatively, use the "üîê Sign in with Google" button for a dedicated sign-in window.

## Technical Details

### Browser Compatibility

This application uses QtWebEngine (Chromium-based) and includes:
- Standard Chrome user agent
- Modern HTTP headers (sec-ch-ua, Sec-Fetch-*)
- JavaScript compatibility layers for Chrome APIs
- Popup window handling

### Profile Storage

Profiles are stored in hidden directories:
```
.multi_vibe_chat_profile_default/
.multi_vibe_chat_profile_work/
.multi_vibe_chat_profile_personal/
```

Each profile contains:
- Cookies and session data
- Local storage
- Cache
- IndexedDB data

### Configuration

Last used profile is stored in `.multi_vibe_chat_config.json`

## Troubleshooting

### "This browser is not supported" errors

Some services may show browser compatibility warnings. Try:
1. Enable "Login Mode" and sign in manually
2. Use the dedicated sign-in dialog
3. Update your PyQt6-WebEngine to the latest version

### Sessions not persisting

Ensure the profile directories have write permissions:
```bash
chmod -R 755 .multi_vibe_chat_profile_*
```

### Pop-ups not working

If OAuth popups don't open:
1. Check that JavaScript is enabled (it should be by default)
2. Try using the manual "üîê Sign in with Google" button
3. Use Login Mode and complete authentication in the main panel

## Development

### Project Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WORKING.py              # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .multi_vibe_chat_*      # Profile directories (auto-generated)
```

### Code Structure

- `RequestInterceptor` - Adds standard HTTP headers
- `CustomWebEnginePage` - Handles navigation and popups
- `CustomWebEngineView` - Main browser view with zoom support
- `MultiVibeChat` - Main application window and logic

## Privacy & Security

- All data is stored locally on your machine, except for queries you are sending to AI providers, obviously
- No telemetry or tracking
- Sessions are isolated per profile
- Use different profiles for different accounts

**Note:** This application stores credentials locally. Ensure your computer is secure and encrypted.
